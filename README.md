Getting Started
To get started with the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Solidity ^0.8.18
A Solidity development environment like Remix
Installation
Open Remix.
Copy the contract code into a new Solidity file (e.g., MyToken.sol).
Usage
Deploying the Contract
Compile the contract in Remix.
Deploy the contract using the "Deploy" button in the Remix interface.
Interacting with the Contract
After deploying the contract, you can interact with it using the provided functions.

Minting Tokens
To mint new tokens, use the mint function. Provide the recipient address and the number of tokens to mint.

solidity
Copy code
mint("0xRecipientAddress", 1000);
This will increase the total supply by 1000 tokens and add 1000 tokens to the recipient's balance.

Burning Tokens
To burn tokens, use the burn function. Provide the address from which to burn the tokens and the number of tokens to burn.

solidity
Copy code
burn("0xYourAddress", 500);
This will decrease the total supply by 500 tokens and subtract 500 tokens from your address's balance, assuming there are enough tokens to burn.
